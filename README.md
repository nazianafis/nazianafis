👋🏼 Hi! I’m a graduate student, currently pursuing M.Tech in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

🎨 I am passionate about visual computing (computer graphics, computer vision, virtual reality, human-computer interactions). I'm also broadly interested in the research on interpretability/explainability of deep neural networks.

😍 I also love listening to podcasts (🎙[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1APpUKebKOXJZjoCaCfoVk)) and trying my hand at photography (📷[Instagram](https://instagram.com/nazianafis)).
